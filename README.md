# GCP BitWarden
Testing a scripted or otherwise automated and orchestrated implementation of BitWarden on Google Cloud.

## Why Bother?
Sometimes a potential client lead brings a piece of tech to my attention that for one reason or another it seems valuable to take it more seriously than others. (As opposed to tech that sounds vaguely interesting where I throw out a quick and ambiguous ballpark because frankly I'm holding onto the faith that something more dope will come along soon if I can be patient and keep my eyes open.)

This is one of the former cases. It's Google Cloud and it's a security-related solution. At the time of this writing, I'm looking to diversify my cloud experience and I'm always trying to stay strong when it comes to security.

That being said, I'm willing to put in some extra research time of my own to take this potential opportunity particularly serious..
